          <p>
            Ship design has undergone remarkable transformation over the past century. From massive steel hulls to sophisticated computer-aided designs, modern vessels represent the pinnacle of engineering excellence. Today's ships are faster, safer, and more efficient than ever before.
          </p>
          <h3>Hull Design and Materials</h3>
          <p>
            Modern ships use advanced hull designs optimized for fuel efficiency. Computer modeling allows designers to test thousands of hull variations before a single vessel is built. Materials science has progressed from iron to steel to aluminum and composite materials, reducing weight while increasing durability and longevity.
          </p>
          <h3>Propulsion Systems</h3>
          <p>
            Contemporary vessels feature sophisticated propulsion systems. Diesel-electric hybrids, liquefied natural gas (LNG) engines, and experimental electric propulsion are changing how ships move through the water. These innovations reduce emissions and operational costs while maintaining the power needed for transoceanic voyages.
          </p>
          <h3>Automation and Safety</h3>
          <p>
            Modern ships are equipped with advanced navigation systems, weather routing software, and automated safety features. Real-time monitoring of vessel performance helps prevent accidents and optimize routes. Some vessels are even being designed for autonomous operation, a revolution in maritime technology.
          </p>
          <h3>Sustainability at Sea</h3>
          <p>
            The shipping industry is responding to environmental concerns with green ship design. Ballast water treatment systems, fuel-efficient bulbous bows, and wind-assisted propulsion are becoming standard. Future ships will continue to prioritize sustainability without compromising performance.
          </p>
          <h3>Conclusion</h3>
          <p>
            The future of ship design lies in balancing performance, safety, and environmental responsibility. As technology advances, we can expect even more innovative solutions that will continue to transform maritime commerce and exploration.
