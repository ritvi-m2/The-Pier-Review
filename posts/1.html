            Why ships matter: Exploring their impact on our world
          </p>
          <p>
            Ships have been a central part of human life for centuries, connecting faraway lands across oceans. Vessels have facilitated trade not just of physical goods, but the exchange of culture, language, cuisines, and much more—shaping human history and the beginning of a connected mankind.

          <h3>Connecting the World</h3>
          <p>
            Ships make the modern world possible. Over 80% of global trade moves by sea, transporting everything from food to electronics. Without ships, economies would be slower, travel more limited, and cultures more isolated. The very concept of globalisation is tied to these floating giants.
          </p>
          <h3>Driving Innovation</h3>
          <p>
            Throughout history, shipbuilding has pushed technological boundaries. From the wooden vessels of the Age of Discovery to modern container ships and cruise liners, each era of ship design reflects human ingenuity. Advanced navigation systems, eco-friendly fuels, and autonomous ships show that the maritime world continues to lead innovation.
          </p>
          <h3>Cultural and Historical Significance</h3>
          <p>
            Ships aren’t just tools; they are symbols of adventure, migration, and cultural exchange. They’ve carried explorers across uncharted waters, connected distant civilisations, and even played critical roles in conflicts and diplomacy. Maritime stories are intertwined with the stories of humanity itself.
          </p>
          <h3>Environmental Impact and Responsibility</h3>
          <p>
            While ships connect the world, they also affect it. Shipping contributes to carbon emissions and marine pollution, challenging us to rethink how we navigate the seas sustainably. Modern innovations in green shipping are working to reduce this impact, showing that ships are not only shaping the world but adapting with it.
          </p>
          <h3>Conclusion</h3>
          <p>
            Ships are more than metal and wood; they are engines of progress, bridges between cultures, and carriers of both opportunity and responsibility. Understanding their impact helps us appreciate not only the vessels themselves but the ways they continue to shape our world today.
